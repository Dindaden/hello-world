# hello-world
My 2 talents worth of thoughts

I am learning to use Python to write a few useful applications, namely:
To help a lecturer make his course interactive for his students to use on a browser.

To write up a design tool that does engineering calculations in either of my preferred fields.

2do
Decide whether Django can accomodate what I really want to do for Dr_WV
Maybe flask can also do this well.
I want to use github, as well as conda to manage my python packages
